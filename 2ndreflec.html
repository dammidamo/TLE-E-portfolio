<p style="font-size:20px;text-indent:25px;">Learning CSS coding has been a challenging yet rewarding experience for me as a student. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful tool that transforms the appearance of a website, turning plain HTML into visually appealing and user-friendly designs. It has taught me how design and functionality go hand in hand in web development. <br><br>

One of the most important lessons I learned is how to structure and organize while coding. Classes, IDs, and grouping selectors showed me how small changes could greatly affect the design. Initially complex, the box model, margins, paddings, and borders were crucial and showed me the importance of precision in design.<br>

I also faced some challenges: debugging when styles didn't apply as expected or where conflicting rules created problems. But overcoming those challenges improved my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of CSS.<br><br>

Overall, learning CSS coding has given me a new appreciation for the artistry and logic behind web design. It has motivated me to explore advanced concepts and it has reinforced the importance of patience and persistence in mastering any skill.</p></font>
