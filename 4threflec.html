<p style="font-size:20px;text-indent:25px;">There's only a few days left until the whole school year will finally come to an end. It's like it was only yesterday when we we're only first starting out as grade 9 students, but it's now 4th quarter. This quarter really made me experience a whole lot of things, some experiences I wasn't ready for, and some experiences I'll be grateful for. Either way, I'll be using both as a valuable life experience for me to look forward. One of the most fun things I really get to do in this school year was coding, though I'm really not the best at it—as if you couldn't already tell by my grades—It was really fun learning CSS and Javascript to furthermore push the capabilities of my electronic portfolio. Though I'd be lying if I said that the coding part was the best in the subject of TLE, because in all honestly, it's really our teacher, Ms. Uminga who really never fails to make our class entertaining and immersive. So for this, we thank you Ms. Uminga for teaching us not only the technical process of coding but also the art and joy of it all. We wish you the best for the upcoming grade 9 students that you'll be teacher next school year and good bless po! </p></font>
